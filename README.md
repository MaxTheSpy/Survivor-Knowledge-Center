# Survivor-Knowledge-Center
## 1.0 Purpose
The purpose of the SKC is to provide a knowledge hub for you and your Local Assistance Group (LAG). Whether your LAG is comprised of friends, family, or people you met when things hit the fan, this will be an important tool to aid you in your new life after the collapse. Do not rely on the SKC as your end all savior. The SKC does not take place of formal training, It is simply to aid the gaps in your knowledge and give you tools to give you a fighting chance. 

to view the documentation correctly, please download Obsidian MD and when launched click open vault, and select the main SKC folder as the vault.
