# Role
This UPS is not entirely needed in this project but is nice to have. 99% of power banks do not have the ability to output battery voltage signals in a way that the [[RaspberryPi4b 8gb]] can understand. This UPS also provides 2-3 hours of additional battery life.

# Use
## Installation
Follow the instructions that came with the "UPS". In order for this configuration to work properly you may need to install the standoffs in the opposite direction in order to interface properly with the standoffs provided by the [[Geekpi Cooling B0B9KM9WYL]].

If you are using the [[Sunfounder PiPower UPS]] alongside the [[Geekpi Cooling B0B9KM9WYL]] there will be an additional gap where the metal standoffs and plastic standoffs do not screw into each other completely, you can either cut the plastic standoffs or just don't worry about the exposed thread. I didn't worry about the exposed thread as that extra space gives me a little more room to access the pins and plated through holes on the [[Sunfounder PiPower UPS]]

After the UPS is installed on the PI with the cooler, you should be able to power on the device and get started on the software side of things!
