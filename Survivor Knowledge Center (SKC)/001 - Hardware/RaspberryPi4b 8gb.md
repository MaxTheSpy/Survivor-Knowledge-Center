# Role 
The Raspberry Pi 4 is the main computer of this build. This computer was chosen for compatibility with third party products, ease of use, and community support. The Raspberry Pi will perform all of the processing and act as the brain of this project.
# Setup
To get the pi working and powered on you will need a [[Sandisk 512gb MicroSD]] (see page for other SD card recommendations) and an imaging software. I highly recommend [[Rufus]] for imaging as cards and flash drives. If you have already set up a raspberry pi before, this should be nothing new.

1. Visit https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/ and download the "Raspberry Pi OS with desktop"
2. Download [[Rufus]]
3. plug in your [[Sandisk 512gb MicroSD]] card into your computer and then launch [[Rufus]]
4. from the device tab, select your sd card, from the boot selection tab select "Disk or ISO" to the right hit select, and in the popup file explorer select the downloaded Raspberry Pi Operating system, click start at the bottom.
5. Once finished, remove the SD card from your computer and insert into the card slot on your raspberry pi. Plug in the raspberry pi into your monitor and make sure it powers on and boots.
