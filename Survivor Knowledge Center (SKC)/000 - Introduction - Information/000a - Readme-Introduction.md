# About
The purpose of the SKC is to provide a knowledge hub for you and your Local Assistance Group (LAG). Whether your LAG is comprised of friends, family, or people you met when things hit the fan, this will be an important tool to aid you in your new life after the collapse. Do not rely on the SKC as your end all savior. The SKC does not take place of formal training, It is simply to aid the gaps in your knowledge and give you tools to give you a fighting chance.

Please read the next categories carefully, this will be a basic overview of the project. More in depth documentation will be available elsewhere.
# Warning
**The SKC is still a work in progress and is not ready to be fully assembled or distributed yet. This document will be updated when all the details are locked down and ready for a final build.**
