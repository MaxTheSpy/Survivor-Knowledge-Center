# Role
The Geekpi active cooler will be the device that keeps your raspberry pi cool, and stop it from thermal throttling. This is not a huge requirement of the project but I have learned from past experience that it really helps to have when needed. 

I typically set the fan to kick on around 75c. The [[RaspberryPi4b 8gb]] starts to thermal throttle at 80 degree and performance will decrease. You could optionally set the temp lower though It does take a small, but measurable, amount of power to run the fan.
# Use
Follow the instructions packaged with the cooler. It is as simple as removing the cooler from the packaging, applying the thermal pads in the specified area and screwing the standoffs through the board. 

This device has known but negligible conflicts with the [[Sunfounder PiPower UPS]].
